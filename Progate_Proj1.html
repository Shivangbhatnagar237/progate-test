            <h3>Hello!</h3>
            <p>I am Shivang Bhatnagar, a first year undergraduate student from <a href="https://lnct.ac.in/lnct-and-science/" target="_blank">Lakshmi Narain College of Technology and Science (LNCT&S), Bhopal</a>.<br>
                I did my 12th class from <a href="http://staloysiusjabalpur.edu.in/index.html">St. Aloysius Senior Secondary School</a>, Jabalpur.<br>
                I am currently in the Computer Science branch.
                <h4>My love for Computer Science</h4>
                When I got to know about the existence of different programming languages (which was probably in my 8th class), learning HTML, CSS, Python etc became my only goal.
                I tried to learn HTML from different websites and videos. I followed many people in order to gain knowledge on different Social Media platforms<br>
                When I got into my 11th grade, I was taught basics of Python and their use in making programs and scripting.
                That propelled me more into the Computer Science community.
                We, nowadays have smart devices (IoT devices) at our homes, for example Alexa and also inbuilt Google Assisstants on our
                mobile devices. That fascinates me a lot. Basically Alexa is a kind of robot, which further lead my interest to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.<br>
